# info-retrieval-notebooks
Some information retrieval algorithms and datastructures (inverted index incl. ranking (bm25-, tf-, idf scores), fuzzy string search, levenshtein distance, ...)

* Designed for viewing in GitHub.

## Implemented Algorithms and Datastructures

### Search
* InvertedIndex

* InvertedIndex (via vector space model, linear algebra, sparse matrices)

* Fuzzy string search

* Ranking and evaluation

### Databases
* Basic database operations (project, select, cartesian product)

* more database operations (equi join, merge join, hash join, group by)

* SPARQL to SQL algorithm

* SQL to SPARQL algorithm 

### Dataset

#### IMDB Dataset
The IMDB dataset contains information about movies, including their names, release dates, user ratings, genres, overviews, cast and crew members, original titles, production status, original languages, budgets, revenues, and countries of origin. This data can be used for various analyses, such as identifying trends in movie genres, exploring the relationship between budget and revenue, and predicting the success of future movies.
